Landesk Parser 
===============

I was on a forensics case and saw that there was no entries in the MFT (event logs, A/V logs, etc.) for gsecdump.exe, but then I happened to see some entries in the SOFTWARE hive when I built my timeline and included the SOFTWARE hive in it. They were dropped around the time of initial infections. gsec was scheduled to run via At jobs.

Then I started playing around with the hive and realized there was a lot of value in these entries.

This is the software: http://www.landesk.com

How to Install
===============

(Going off memory here)

Python

- Python 2.7

Python Registry

- Download: https://github.com/williballenthin/python-registry
- python setup.py build
- python setup.py install

Done...

Running
=========

python landesk-parse.py -h
              
              usage: landesk-parse.py [-h] [-soft SOFTWARE]

              Parse the Landesk Entries in the Registry.

              optional arguments:
                -h, --help            show this help message and exit
                -soft SOFTWARE, --software SOFTWARE
                                      Path to the SOFTWARE hive you want parsed.

Output Example
===============
              python landesk-parse.py -soft SOFTWARE
